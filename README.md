For people who are just starting their way into the world of deep learning by reading a book or probably taking an online course or in school, there are two concepts that are the base for building the foundation of machine learning those are linear regression and logistic regression.

Linear and logistic regression are the must-understand algorithms when it comes to deep learning since both prediction and classification are built on top of them, the idea of a neuron comes from them.

This repository has a different set of datasets with different sizes and a different number of features grouped by application while some of them are more suitable for prediction some others are more for classification, as well as some of them are more suitable for some level of regularisation (L1 and L2) while others not, and that's for you to decide.

The code base already implements the most recommended methods for each dataset but you are free to play as you pleased.
